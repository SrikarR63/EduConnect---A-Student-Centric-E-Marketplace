<p class="mt-2"><b>Edu-Connect</b> is an e-marketplace website that creates an ecosystem for the sellers and customers, both being hosteller students, to perform easy transaction of goods for reasonable cost. The main focus is on bridging the communication gap between the students of your college through a web portal, which helps facilitate the exchange of second-hand goods among students. The products that can be exchanged include books, sports equipment, electronic gadgets, and project hardware/software. The goal of your startup is to help students save money by providing a platform for them to rent or buy items from their peers at a lower cost, as opposed to buying costly products from outside for immediate or short-term use.

<hr>
<p>College students, especially those living in hostels find difficulty in buying new products which are needed to satisfy their academic requirements on a day-to-day basis, either owing to the cost of the product, or its availability. 
Therefore in such a scenario, introducing a web portal which can facilitate the easy exchange of goods among peers within the campus enclosure, will provide an easy and secure solution. Since, both the seller and the customer are students of the same university, the supplier-buyer communication gap is bridged, time to acquire the product is less and cost of the product is highly reduced. Through our website we aim to provide a platform for the students to find out and interact with their peers who are willing to rent (or) sell the desired products within the campus enclosure. This tool will therefore be instrumental in reducing the time required for a student to acquire a product (eg: An Arduino board for a project) and will help in building good relationships among students.
