# EduConnect---A-Student-Centric-E-Marketplace
Web Development Project

1.1 Vision

The vision is to implement an e-marketplace (website) that creates an ecosystem for the sellers and customers both being students, to perform easy transaction of goods for reasonable cost. 
The main focus is on bridging the communication gap between the students of our college through a web site which will help facilitate the exchange of second-hand goods among students. 

1.2 Objectives

•	Providing an online web portal for connecting the sellers who are willing to sell or let products for rent and customers who are interested in buying/renting them.

•	To implement such a useful exchange system in a college environment (ie. within the student community)

•	The products including books, sports equipment, electronic gadgets and project hardware/software.

•	To help students save money, as, instead of buying costly products from outside for immediate or short-term use, they can rent/buy items from their peers at a lesser price.

•	Time is always precious. By borrowing from peers the customer(student) can get the product in less time.

2.1 Scope

College students, especially those living in hostels find difficulty in buying new products which are needed to satisfy their academic requirements on a day-to-day basis, either owing to the cost of the product, or its availability. 
Therefore in such a scenario, introducing a web portal which can facilitate the easy exchange of goods among peers within the campus enclosure, will provide an easy and secure solution.

Since, both the seller and the customer are students of the same university, the supplier-buyer communication gap is bridged, time to acquire the product is less and cost of the product is highly reduced.

2.2 Target Audience

Our web portal is mainly targeted towards the students of our university. Since majority of the students in VIT are hostellers, they are faced with a large number of day-to-day needs - both educational and for other essential items. Buying a new product from outside might not always be a feasible option considering the cost factor and time at hand. Also it is difficult to find peers who have or are willing to share a product in our close circles. 

Through our website we aim to provide a platform for the students to find out and interact with their peers who are willing to rent (or) sell the desired products within the campus enclosure. This tool will therefore be instrumental in reducing the time required for a student to acquire a product (eg: An Arduino board for a project) and will help in building good relationships among students.
